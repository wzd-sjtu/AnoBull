Project about Single Sign On System.

Traditional IDP and RP Problems.

Written in C, with PBC and GMP libraries.

Complete in ARM architecture.

My Graduate Design.

SiggleSignOn_Algorithm_Verify is a list of projects which verify the algorithm, prove that the algorithm is right.

AnoBull is the main part of the project, which include IDP Server, Client Side, RP Server and Tenant Server.  

There are also design documents and README in every child project.

Now I have finished the design of the IDP Server.
